# Assignment: Product Catalog API

## Overview
You are tasked with developing a RESTful API for a product catalog system. This API will serve as the backend for an e-commerce platform, allowing administrators to manage products and users to browse and search the catalog.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Support for adding, retrieving, updating, and removing products from the catalog
2. Ability to organize products into categories and collections
3. Search functionality to find products by name, description, or other attributes
4. Support for product variants (e.g., different sizes, colors)
5. Inventory tracking for products and variants
6. Basic pricing and discount support

### Technical Requirements
1. Develop the API using Node.js and Express.js
2. Design the API following RESTful principles
3. Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. Ensure input validation and data sanitization
5. Include comprehensive API documentation

### Expected Endpoints
Your implementation must provide endpoints for:
- Product management (create, read, update, delete)
- Category management
- Product search and filtering
- Inventory management
- Basic reporting (e.g., low stock items)

## Submission Instructions
1. Submit your complete source code via the designated submission method
2. Include a README file containing:
   - Setup and installation instructions
   - API documentation with endpoint descriptions
   - Example requests and responses
   - Any assumptions or limitations of your implementation
3. Be prepared to explain your design decisions during evaluation

## Evaluation Criteria
Your assignment will be assessed on:
1. Functionality (40%) - Does the API fulfill all requirements?
2. Code Quality (25%) - Is the code well-organized, maintainable, and efficient?
3. API Design (20%) - Are the endpoints logical, consistent, and follow REST principles?
4. Error Handling (10%) - Does the API properly handle errors and edge cases?
5. Documentation (5%) - Is the API well-documented and easy to understand?

## Extension Opportunities
For higher grades, consider implementing:
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Persistent storage with a database
- Advanced search functionality
- Image handling for product photos
- Performance optimizations
